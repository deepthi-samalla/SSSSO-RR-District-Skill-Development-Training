#With() helps prevent:
    #Forgetting to close the file manually.
    #File corruption or data loss due to improper closure.
    #Cleaner syntax and automatic resource management.

#Example code:
try:
    with open("example.txt", "r") as file:   #Opens the file in read mode
        content = file.read()    #Reads the entire content of the file
        print("File content:")  #prints a message indicating the content will be printed
        print(content)    #Prints the content of the file
except FileNotFoundError:    #Catches the exception if the file doen't exist
    print("The file does not exist.")   #Prints a message indicating the file doesn't exist

#Output:
#File content:
#This will print the content of the file if it exists, otherwise it will print an error message
