In halls of digital, where data sleeps,
A subtle language, deep within it keeps.
File modes, guardians of the byte and line,
Define who sees, who alters, who can twine.

The user, owner of this digital seed,
Holds primary sway, a powerful creed.
Then group, a brotherhood, a chosen few,
Sharing access, what they may pursue.
And others, shadows in the vast domain,
Granted glimpses, or held back from gain.

The read bit, R, a silent, knowing eye,
Allows the content to be drifting by.
To glimpse the verses, or the numbers bright,
But leaves untouched, in its own gentle light.

The write bit, W, a sculptor's potent hand,
To shape and mold, across the digital sand.
To add new lines, to alter what's begun,
A power to change, beneath the digital sun.

The execute bit, X, a vibrant, living plea,
To run the program, set the spirit free.
To make the script perform its destined art,
A breath of life, within the program's heart.

In threes they gather, a numerical dance,
From 0 to 7, a coded, quick glance.
Like 777, a world flung open wide,
No lock, no bar, where all may freely stride.
Or 644, a whisper, soft and low,
Read for all, but only owner's write can flow.

So heed the wisdom, when you set their gleam,
These humble bits, a power in a dream.
For through their grace, or through their strict decree,
The digital world unfolds for all to see.
