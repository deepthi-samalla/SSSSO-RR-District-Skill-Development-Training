Boy: Swami! why is there so much suffering in the world?
Swami: My child, suffering exists to awaken the heart. Just as gold is purified in fire, humans grow through challenges.
Boy: But Swami, how can I help others when I feel small and weak?
Swami: Even a small lamp can light a dark room. One kind word, one selfless act, can touch many lives.
Boy: Swami, how do I know what is right and wrong?
Swami: Let your conscience be your guide. Ask yourself: "Is this good for me and good for others?" That is the voice of God within.
Boy: Swami, what is the most important thing I should do every day?
Swami: Love all. Serve all. Speak softly. Think purely. Act selflessly. That is the way to reach Me.
Boy: Thank you, Swami. I will follow your words.
Swami: Good boy! Remember, My life is My message. Let your life be My Message.
