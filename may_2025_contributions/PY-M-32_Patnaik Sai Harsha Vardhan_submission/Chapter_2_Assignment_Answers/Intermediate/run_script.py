#11.Run a Python script using both the Python interpreter and a code editor. Note the differences.
# This is a simple script
print("Running from script")

'''Using Python Interpreter:
> python run_script.py
Output: Running from script

Using Code Editor (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm):
- Output appears in the integrated terminal or output console.
- Editors show syntax errors in real-time; interpreter doesnâ€™t until execution.

Differences:
- Editors provide features like debugging, autocomplete, and error linting.
- Interpreter is faster for quick testing.'''
