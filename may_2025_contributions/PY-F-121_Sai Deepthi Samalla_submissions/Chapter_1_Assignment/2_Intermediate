1. Compare Python with Java in terms of syntax simplicity and productivity.
* Simplicity: Python (very simple, less verbose, indentation); Java (verbose, strict, curly braces).
* Productivity: Python (higher, rapid dev, vast libraries); Java (lower for quick dev, robust for large enterprise).

2. Write short notes on Python's role in: (a) Data Science (b) Web Development
* (a) Data Science: Dominant for analysis, ML/DL, visualization (NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow).
* (b) Web Development: Popular for backend, APIs (Django, Flask); powers major sites.

3. List any 4 popular Python frameworks/libraries and their use cases.
* Django: Web framework for complex web apps.
* Flask: Micro-web framework for simple web apps/APIs.
* NumPy: Numerical computing, array operations.
* Pandas: Data analysis, manipulation, cleaning.

4. What are some limitations of Python despite its popularity?
* Slower execution speed.
* Higher memory consumption.
* Not primary for native mobile dev.
* Runtime type errors.
* GIL limits CPU parallelism.

5. How does Python support rapid prototyping and development?
* Concise syntax, vast libraries (less code needed), no compilation step (instant testing).

6. Why is Python considered a dynamically typed language?
* Variable types are checked/determined at runtime, not declared or fixed during coding.

7. How do readability and indentation in Python differ from other languages?
* Readability: Core philosophy, clean, English-like syntax.
* Indentation: Mandatory, defines code blocks (vs. optional, uses curly braces in others).

8. What makes Python open source? How can you contribute to it?
* Source code is free and publicly available, developed by community.
* Contribute: code, docs, bug reports, testing, community support.

9. Find and list at least 5 real-world companies that use Python and what they use it for.
* Google: Search, YouTube, ML/AI.
* Netflix: Recommendation engine, data analysis.
* Instagram: Backend (Django framework).
* Spotify: Backend, data analysis, recommendations.
* NASA: Scientific programming, data analysis.

10. Explain the phrase “Python fits everywhere” with examples.
* Highlights its extreme versatility across diverse domains due to extensive libraries.
* Examples: Web dev, Data Science, AI, Automation, Scientific computing, DevOps.
