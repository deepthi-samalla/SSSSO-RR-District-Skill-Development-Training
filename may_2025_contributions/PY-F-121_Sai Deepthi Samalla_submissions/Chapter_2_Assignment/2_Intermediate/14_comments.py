# Chapter 2 - Intermediate Assignment 4: Single-line and Multi-line Comments
# Question: Demonstrate both single-line and multi-line comments in the same script.

# This is a single-line comment. Everything after the '#' on this line is ignored by Python.

"""
This is a multi-line comment, also known as a docstring when used
at the beginning of a module, function, or class.
Python treats it as a string literal if not assigned to a variable,
and effectively ignores it for execution.
"""

# Another single-line comment: Let's print something to show the script is running.
print("This script demonstrates comments!") # This is an inline comment.
